         Congestion Control Using FEC for Conversational Media
                   draft-singh-rmcat-adaptive-fec-00

Abstract

   This document describes a new mechanism for conversational multimedia
   flows.  The proposed mechanism uses Forward Error Correction (FEC)
   encoded RTP packets (redundant packets) along side media packets to
   probe for available network capacity.  A straightforward
   interpretation is, the sending endpoint increases the sending rate by
   keeping the media rate constant but increases the amount of FEC.  If
   no losses and discards occur, the endpoint can then increase the
   media rate.  If losses occur, the redundant FEC packets help in
   recovering the lost packets.  Consequently, the endpoint can vary the
   FEC bit rate to conservatively (by a small amount) or aggressively
   (by a large amount) probe for available network capacity.

1.  Introduction

   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550] is widely used in
   voice telephony and video conferencing systems.  Many of these
   systems run over best-effort UDP/IP networks, and are required to
   implement congestion to adapt the transmission rate of the multimedia
   streams to match the available network capacity, while maintaing the
   user-experience [I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements].  The circuit
   breakers [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-circuit-breakers] describe a minimal
   set of conditions when an RTP media stream is causing severe
   congestion and should cease transmission.  Consequently, the
   congestion control algorithm are expected to avoid triggering these
   conditions.

   Conversational multimedia systems use Negative Acknowlegment (NACK),
   Forward Error Correction (FEC), and Reference Picture Selection (RPS)
   to protect against packet loss.  These are used in addition to the
   codec-dependent resilience methods (for e.g., full intra-refresh and
   error-concealment).  In this way, the multimedia system is anyway

   trading off part of the sending rate for redundancy or
   retransmissions to reduce the effects of packet loss.  An endpoint
   often prefers using FEC in high latency networks where
   retransmissions may arrive later than the playout time of the packet
   (due to the size of the dejitter buffer) [Holmer13].  Therefore, the
   endpoint needs to adapt the transmission rate to best fit the
   changing network capacity and the amount of redundancy based on the
   observed/expected loss rate and network latency.  Figure 1 shows the
   applicatbility of different error-resilience schemes based on the
   end-to-end latency and the observed packet loss [Devadoss08].

                  network delay and observed packet loss

   In this document, we describe the use of FEC packets not only for
   error-resilience but also as a probing mechanism for congestion
   control (ramping up the transmission rate).
